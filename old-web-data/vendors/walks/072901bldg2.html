</B></FONT><P>I’m including everything I found during the walkthroughs including "long-term" projects. I’ll indicate these as LT (indicating they won’t get fixed immediately and might need board approval, but nevertheless good things to get on our radar if not already). Sometimes I’ll indicate "north", "east", etc, stairways. This of course is relative to the building itself (and I apologize for not specifying to the level of, say, "northwest").</P>

<P>This walkthrough generally encompasses routine inspections of the immediate grounds inside and outside the building. It covers tasks that maintenance and/or janitorial staff should be able to fix. It does not cover tasks that we are not qualified to make any comments about, since we are not licensed professionals, or might in any way compromise our safety: assessing elevator reliability, determining if fire extinguishers are working properly, etc. All we can do in these cases is indicate a potential problem. </P>
