<LI>We have LaShawn working in the office on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 2 until 7 p.m. We have started nite staff as of Monday July 10, 2000. We will still need one or two more people to work part time with the nite staff. Maintenance is still not filled.

<P><LI>The bids for the carpet cleaning are enclosed, please check the prices. I have asked each company to double-check the amount on the bids. All have added for the stairs and all have confirmed the bid amounts are correct. </LI></P>
<P><LI>Have started calling roofing companies for information and bids for the repairs of the buildings. </LI></P>
<P><LI>Have received one tile bid besides the one from condo-mgmt. I am still waiting for another bid, or two. </LI></P>

<P><LI>The repairs to Building 3 door and panel have been completed. We need to plan in the budget for these, as there will be more in the future. </LI></P>
<P><LI>All items have been retrieved from Condo-mgmt.  </LI></P>
<P><LI>The new equipment has been set up and is working, the fax/copier/scanner from before does not seem to work as a fax, but the old thermal fax has been located and this will save the cost of buying a new one.</LI></P>
