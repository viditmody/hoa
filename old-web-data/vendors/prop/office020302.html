   All,<br>
<p> I started calling owners of units with toilets perpetually running. This 
 is a twofold problem: neighbors complain of the noise and everyone should
 be interested in reducing water usage, therefore reducing our costs. Response 
 from one owner was very positive, the other did not seem to think it was 
worth his time. I will verify on Monday whether or not repairs were made.</p>
<p> Fremont Bank began courier service for deposits this week.</p>
<p> EST phoned me at home Saturday afternoon to say there was an alarm in
 Bldg. I asked them to call me back if they could not reach Jonathan. Since
 I did not hear from them again I assume they were able to contact someone
 on site.</p>
<p> PacBell was scheduled to work on the T1 line Friday. We did not see anyone 
from PacBell so I hope they will be there Monday.</p>
<pr>The new weight room door looks nice now. It's painted and it's closing 
properly. But All Seasons needs to solve the gutter problem before another 
rain so it will stay looking nice. Thanks to all of you for your fast responses
 to the email about their bid.</pr>
<p>Reed Electric will be here Monday to install light pole #85 in the north 
courtyard. And they will finish up the parking light ballast installations, 
repair short in fountain switch in Bldg. 5, repair lights in front of the 
Murieta sign and I will ask him about a new light at the weight room.</p>
<p>Jerry from Sound Communications is scheduled to take a look at the north 
and south entry systems with the goal of cutting down to two phone lines
(from eight).</p>
<p>   And, as you all know, Pacheco Bros. will start our tree project Monday.</p>
<p>Ecoloclean began the new schedule and one of their first efforts was washing 
windows in the north clubhouse. There will be a manager doing some time  study
analysis on carpet stain removal, beginning in Bldg. 8.</p>
<p>   Newsletter and invoices were mailed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>   Hope everyone had a Super Sunday!</p>
