Goodmorning Everyone.  There is alot to read here so be patient!
</p>
<p>
Friday was a typical day for me.  9am met with the fire estinguisher recharging comapany as the estinguishers are due this week.  The total is $900 which is about $50 more than last year.  All need recharging and some need replacement due to damage or they are missing.
</p>
<p>
9:30am   Met with Hands on Construction for repair of a homeowners unit.  Their unit is coming along as scheduled with the usual drama that is associated with such a remodel.  I am putting their fears at ease as best I can.  We cut them another $6500 check with a final payment of $3000 remaining.
</p>
<p>
10:00am  Carl and I met with Dryco and walked the area they are to work on.  They will be installing a speed bump, two sign poles and painting directional arrows / traffic control lines on the main drive in area.  They will call me with scheduling.
</p>
<p>
10:30am  Met with Red Top electric to go over electrical repairs around the association.  He looked at the light poles that need replacing, the ballasts that need replacing along the back wall, the fountains and the chandeliers.  They are faxing me a proposal for the work. 
</p>
<p>
2:00pm  Met with three representitives from Fremont Bank and I feel pretty good about the Banking services that they can provide the Association.  We discussed moving our operating, reserve, clubhouse and payroll accounts to their institution.  We also talked about APS, drop box service, PC banking and possible CD's for the future.  I'll run it down to everyone at the next meeting  and I have the papers to sign upon your approval.  Its a great move because they are local, provide quality services we need and the association will have more of their accounts at one central institution.
</p>
<p>
This week I will be working on the tile repairs that need to be done, especially the trouble spots in the main entry and building 4.  
</p>
<p>
Also, I have a plumber coming out to give the Association a proposal to remove and replace the hose bibs that are damaged and worn throughout the campus. 
</p>
<p>
I have two companies coming out today in order to prepare proposals for the glass front doors to be replaced (and/or repaired as I think would be a better and more cost effective move).
</p>
<p>
I will be going to Regans nursury in Fremont to look at some fountain setups they have.  They have the best selection in the area and coming to a conclusion with this matter will bring alot of joy to the homeowners.
</p>
<p>
The welder who did the gate repairs is coming out to give me a proposal on how  much it will cost to put a metal shroud on the pool gates when we change the key locks to handles on the inside as the board decided to do.
</p>
<p>
I am keeping a manual log of which homeowners paid this month so we can keep accurate records starting May 1 and send out late notices as neccessary.
