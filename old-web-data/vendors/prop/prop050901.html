Here is the managers report!
</p>
<p>
I met with Pacheco Brothers to discuss the general appearance of the 
grounds.  We discussed the reseeding by the South clubhouse and thinning
 out the tree cover above the South main entry.  The banana trees are 
being trimmed down throughout the campus.  They are doing great work.
</p>
<p>
Spa Masters pressure checked the solar heating system and found a small
 leak which they repaired.  The Solar heaters are now on and should be
 warming up the h20 in the next few days.
</p>
<p>
The checks for the reroofing (104k) and insurance (52k) have been cashed
leaving the operating account w/ 30k.  I will be making a bank deposit 
today or tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
There was a main drain overflow in building 7 and the unit on the 1st 
floor suffered damage.  I had the carpet cleaners dispatched and they 
soaked up the mess and had to change the pad. Jonathan and I performed 
a walk through.
</p>
<p>
We have two CD's maturing soon.  Fireside financial on 7/7 and Western 
Financial on 7/8. I have a meeting with Fremont Bank on Friday.
</p>
<p>
The electrician is coming on Friday to tour the campus and give us an 
overview of what needs to be repaired and how much.  This includes the 
chandeliers, fountains and hps lamps.
</p>
<p>
I have informed our janitorial service to pay attention to the call box
 entry cobwebs and the stairwells.  Let me know how they are doing.  I 
have them doing a strip and wax on one of the buildings so we can see 
what condition the floor is really in. Joseph is replacing lights 
throughout the campus and performing his regular duties.
</p>
<p>
This is a partial list of whats going on, so if you want to know exact 
details....you know where to find me.
