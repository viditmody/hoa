<div align="Center"><b>Weekly report for Friday, March 16, 2001</b><br>
</div>
<br>
<ol type="1">
<p>
<li>We hired a part time office assistant to work the afternoon shift and 
will start Wednesday.&nbsp; Grace will come out the first day and train her.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Planning to rent a buffer for the front lobbies, possible week and have
our Janitors do the work. It cost $77.00 a week and $35.00 to deliver it.
Hopefully this project can start next week.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>The new front door intercom in Building #8 is installed and working.
About five homeowners have not replied back with a phone and name to enter
in.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Roofing project is in full swing on building #4.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Carl &amp; I met with the Brad Myer, Project advisor for All Seasons Roofing
Services and walked all roofs completed.&nbsp; We made a payment of $87,426.90</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Joseph is gathering tile bids for the complex.&nbsp; We plan to do the
worst ones first and then repair cracked tiles later.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Received a bid from Pacheco Brothers for removing 13 palm trees. The bid<br>
is lower than others we received from other vendors.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Leslie Ingrams CPA came out on Thursday to review and update Quickbooks.
She will need to come out one more time next week. Maybe Thursday?</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>I did a check run last night and paid most vendors. Still need to sort 
out some invoices.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Cleaned up the office and got rid of junk that has been cluttering up
the room.&nbsp; I am about 70% finished and should be almost complete before
the new part time office assistant starts.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Grace is handling the voice mails and replying to them. This is a big 
burden removed from my shoulders.&nbsp; She is also taking care of the Escrow 
packages.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>We have not had alarm troubles in building #7 in two days and seem to
be working.&nbsp; A couple of nights ago, Joseph was receiving pages all night
from people complaining about the alarm going off and he only got one hour of 
sleep.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>We are having an increase in cars parked in guest parking after hours 
without a note or permit.&nbsp; Handed out about 7 warning notices to these 
vehicles</li>
