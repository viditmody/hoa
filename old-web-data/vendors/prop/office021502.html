<p>All,</p>

<p>Water in wrong places continues to be focus of the office.</p>

<p>Giant Plumbing has repaired the leak under entrance way between Bldg. 5 and 8. This one was a crack in the 90 degree part of a 4-inch main line. Lots of water. Now they are asking about backfill. The dirt is so saturated that it's useless for backfill. We considered letting it dry out over the weekend; weather may not cooperate since there's rain in the forecast. I know it sounds far-fetched but the best solution may be to have the mud hauled away and "fresh" dirt delivered so the hole can be closed up. I would welcome any suggestions here.</p>

<p>And now we are investigating another location in front of Bldg. 5 where the ground is very mushy. Have a leak detector coming today for this spot.</p>

<p>Reed Electric will finish the parking lot lights today.</p>

<p>Sound Communications will be here next week to install software on office computer to allow us to program Access Codes in Building 8. On this trip they will also show us how to change the security codes on all buildings.</p>

<p>Alliance Drywall has started skylight project in all buildings.</p>

<p>I have a second bid on the hot water heaters and this one is from a local plumber and includes a 5% "Fremont Chamber" discount. Otherwise it is the same amount as Aquaflow ($1400). Ventilation for these rooms could be achieved with louvered doors. Stacey Murray has suggested purchasing solid doors and then cutting ventilation access at top and bottom of each door. I will compare prices on solid and louvered doors, here again I would welcome 
any comments.</p>

<p>PacBell is scheduled to be here today for the T1 line.</p>

<p>Gates R Us will begin changing locks on swimming pool gates next Tuesday.</p>

<p>I wish everyone a happy Presidents Day weekend. I'm looking forward to 3 days in the mountains.</p>
