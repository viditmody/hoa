 All,<br>
<p> Water problems spouted up everywhere this week.</p>
<p> A resident who has complained for quite some time about the sound of
a  toilet running in a unit beneath her, also called to ask why the fountains 
were turned off--said she loved to listen to them.</p>
<p> As Jonathan mentioned we are working on the leak in front between Bldg.
5 and 8. Alameda County Water Dept. will be here a 11 AM on Monday to shut 
water off in North buildings. Leak detectors are coming and right behind them
should be Giant Plumbing.</p>
<p> Alliance Drywall plans to begin the skylights next Tuesday.</p>
<p> We had two exterior gates jammed this week. One was between Bldg. 3 and
the parking lot and the other was in front of the mail boxes between 7 and
8. Both required nighttime trips by Gold Key and Lock. And both locks had
 something broken off in them. One was a key and the other looked like end 
of an ice pick.</p>
<p> All Seasons got gutters cleaned on both north and south clubhouses. They 
plan to start the flashing project "right away." We talked about the wire 
covers over dryer vents and Brad said they were designed to be easily  removed
for cleaning. These are custom-made and maybe we need to reconsider having
them removed. (?) He is waiting on his sheet metal person for a bid on the
chimney covers. Will try to provide it for next week's meeting.</p>
<p> For those board members who wish to see a sample of the new doors similar 
to ones on Store Front Door bid: these doors are installed at&nbsp; St. Leonards 
School, 3635 St. Leonards Way in Fremont. (Directions: east on Stevenson to
Fremont Blvd. Right on Fremont to Mission View, left on Mission View then 
immediate right on frontage road. Go to end then turn left on St. Leonards 
Way into school grounds. School is to the left.) The school is happy with 
their doors. They are open 8 AM - 3 PM. and it is OK with them if people stop
by to view the doors.</p>
<p> There was a dishwasher dumped by trash shed behind the office. Al Hansen 
came and picked it up. Do you think it would help if I put a sign on any large
items something like: REWARD. $50 TO ANYONE PROVIDING THE OFFICE WITH IDENTIFICATION
OF WHERE THIS ITEM ORIGINATED. Do you think that would help eliminate the
problem?</p>
<p> I would love some direction regarding distribution of the plastic guest
 parking hangers. Any ideas welcomed. So far, they are sitting in a box in 
the UPS closet.</p>
<p> Ernest has been ill since Tuesday so if you see things seeming to slip,
 please be patient. He should be back Monday.</p>
<p> Happy weekend!</p>
