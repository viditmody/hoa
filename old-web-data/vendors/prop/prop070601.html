Hello everyone.  Hope everyone had a good 4th of July.

I met with Waste Management for what I hope is the last time before we start our recycling program.  I will have the proposal for the Board to approve on Wednesdays meeting.  They are trying to work out a good plan taking into consideration our space limitations and size of campus.

Electric express came out and bid our chandelier needs.  This is the company that Common Sense uses.  I have looked everywhere for an exact chandelier to replace it with and have come up with not one that has the antique finish.  They all have the polished finish.  I suggest utilizing the polished as they are the exact shape and size of the existing ones.  More importantly, I'd like to see them changed before one of the old ones falls on someone.  Please advise.

The water fountains have also been addressed by Water Works and they have proposed a wonderful all encased unit that is secured to the bottom of the fountains.  They will run approximately $400 each.  I will have the proposal for you approval on Wed as well.
Dryco has come out and painted the directional lines on the entrance blacktop and have installed the stop signs as well.
