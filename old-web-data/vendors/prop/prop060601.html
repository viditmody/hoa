Tomorrow, Pacheco brothers will be coming out at 10am to do the walkthrough as you requested.  Please meet at the office at that time.
The palm tree removal is in progress.  They are working swiftly and amazingly quiet.

The carport roof repair is also in progress and moving along.
The damaged door to building 7 is ready to be repaired (after a decade Im told.)  The cost will be $800.00 to remove the door, cut it and replace.  Pls advise with board vote.

The spa covers have been ordered and replaced.  I also had spa  masters come in and reinstall the pool light as someone had pulled it out!

The checks are ready to be signed and I will leave them in the office for Jonathan to pick up.

I have created bookkeeping procedure for the AP and AR for Angel.  She is doing great.  Since I have a much better handle on all the things that were on fire here, I am able to give her much more responsibility and she is performing well.  Some of the duties she is handling are all the AR input, creating new 2001 files as the files we have are still for 2000 and preparing the biweekly bank deposits just to name a few.
