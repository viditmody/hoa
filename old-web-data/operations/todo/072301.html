&nbsp;Good Morning Lawrence,<br>
Item no 1 &amp; 2 is a follow up from my Voice Mail. Call me on my cell phone
if you have any questions. I will be gone all day.<br>
<br>
1. Contact Marda Casablanca @ 790-2803. She claims we have not given her
"Rental Deposit" back or "Key Deposit."&nbsp; Look into this TODAY and contact
Marda that you are handling it. She has been requesting this since May.<br>
<br>
2. Are we going to get board packages today by hard copy or E-mail?<br>
<br>
3. Need the signs posted today, inside the glass bulletin boards, that we
are having a Business Meeting followed by an Executive Session.<br>
<br>
4. A sign has been knocked down again at the car wash. Need to put the sign
up higher on the poll.<br>
<br>
Just a reminder; since this is an extra meeting, we will take our own minutes.
You will not be needed at the Business Meeting or Executive Meeting. <br>
