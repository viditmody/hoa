1. Need the drains to be cleaned out on the roof of building #1, Stevenson
side. Leaves and pollen from the trees are clogging up the drains.&nbsp;
This problem should go away when we prune back the trees. Also, these are
new drains.<br>
2. Need the signs posted in the glass bulletin boards about the Wednesday
Business Meeting, followed by an Executive Session Meeting.<br>
3. Need the information from Paul Zane on the Lo claim.<br>
<br>
Other:<br>
We may have found where we have been wasting water. We had a leak from an
improper rubber hose connected to a pipe for the solar panels, instead of
a plastic sleeve.<br>
