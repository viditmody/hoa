&nbsp;Good morning,<br>
1. Start logging in the UPS packages when they come in, instead of going
out and call residents that they have packages at the office. This way we
move them out faster.<br>
2. Have all the new bank accounts been open yet? Friday was the dead line
to open up these new accounts.<br>
3. If the new bank accounts are open, then we will transfer all the funds
out of the Clubhouse account at San Jose National Bank into the New Clubhouse
Account at Fremont Bank.&nbsp; $800.00 needs to go into the operating account
from the purchase of the pool furniture. This $800.00 should go into the
new Operating Account at Fremont Bank.<br>
4. Per our conversation about the weight room door bid, also get a bid on
a card reader. Gold Key &amp; Lock may be the first place to start.<br>
5. The lights outside the weight room are out.<br>
6. The janitors need to start cleaning the weight room and a sign is about
to fall down inside the weight room. This is a safety hazard &amp; is a top
priority to fix. <br>
7. When is Spa Masters going to fix (new motor) the South Spa?<br>
