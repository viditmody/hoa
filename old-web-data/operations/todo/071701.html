1. Before the locksmith rekeys the locks, for the missing key, to the switch
rooms, I need to know the cost. If this goes over $500.00, as I see the cost
of $1000.00, the board will need to vote on it.<br>
<br>
2. Effective immediately: Anytime keys are handed out to vendors (Pacific
Bell or AT&amp;T) to the switch room/ telephone room, some type of ID must
be taken for collateral. Also make a photocopy of the service order. (NO
ID or SERVICE ORDER, NO KEY)&nbsp; NO EXCEPTIONS. Any employee not following
this new procedure will be terminated.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
A letter needs to be sent out to Pacific Bell &amp; AT&amp;T of this policy.
Also include in this letter of the available hours these vendors have access
this room.<br>
<br>
See attached file. I want everyone to sign it and understand this policy.
If anyone has questions, I will be happy to explain it. This should be the
last time we lose keys and do not know who has it. <br>
<br>
When we get the new keys, lets have a big key chain, like they do at gas
stations.&nbsp; <br>
