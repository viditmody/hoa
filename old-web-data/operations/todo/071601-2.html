1. We have a personal satellite dish on the roof of building #5, Cedar side,
that needs to be removed.&nbsp; About 6 to 8 months ago, a notice was sent
to this homeowner to remove the dish, but the homeowner has not removed it
yet. Send a 2nd notice that they have 7 days to remove the dish or the HOA
will take it down.<br>
<br>
2. A front gate is staying open between building #4 &amp; #1. The spring
release came apart.<br>
<br>
3. Building #4, 3rd floor, mail box side, staying open. The spring release
came apart.<br>
<br>
4. Found a couch near the dumpster that is in good condition and is now in
the South Clubhouse. Next time you call the hauling company, have them remove
the small orange couch in the South Clubhouse<br>
<br>
5. Do not need the phone number and address for the legal counsel for the
D&amp;O insurance policy.<br>
<br>
6. Call the fire dept. to see if it is safe to put up a 2x2 or 4x4 fenced
in area to store gas and propane. This would be located in the corner of
the north, west section of the property.<br>
<br>
7. What are we going to do about the weight room door?<br>
