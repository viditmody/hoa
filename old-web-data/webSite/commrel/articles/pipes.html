By Carl Street  3/26/01</b></p>
<p>
This article is about the responsibility for the repair of a hot water pipe and how that responsibility is determined.
</p>
<ol type=1>
<p>
<li>The HOA is legally required to maintain all COMMON AREA property.</li>
<li>The HOA is legally PROHIBITED from using community funds for the benefit of PRIVATE units.</li>
<li>Everything INSIDE your unit is considered your private property and you are responsible for its maintenance.</li>
<li>Everything that is exclusively for the use of your unit is considered your private property and you are responsible for its maintenance.  This last item would include for example:</li>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Your telephone line between your unit and your building's connection room</li>
<li>Your TV cable between your unit and your building's connection room</li>
<li>Your dryer vent pipe between your unit and your building's roof</li>
<li>Your furnace and/or fireplace chimney between your unit and your building's roof</li>
<li>Plumbing vent pipes between your unit and your building;s roof</li>
<li>Your sewer connection between your unit and your building's common sewer pipe</li>
<li>Your water supply pipe between your unit and your building's common supply line</li>
<li>Your water pipes at any point after they leave your building's supply line.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
You will note that many of the items cited in the example are actually NOT within the physical boundaries of your unit, however, they ARE still your responsibility to maintain under the doctrine of exclusive use.  Please note that the above exclusive use examples may not be a complete list.
