by Carl Street<br>
       February 8, 2002</big></div>
       
      <p></p>
      <p><big> I would like to   address many of the popular but ERRONEOUS
myths, theories  and  misunderstandings  of the relationships of involved
parties and the legal  definition of responsibility.   Hopefully, the following
will clarify...</big></p>
         
      <ol>
        <big>    </big><li><big> A person is responsible for the actions
of themselves AND their property.    Whether or not damage is caused intentionally,
IS IMMATERIAL to their  civil  responsibility for the damage.  For example,
if you left your unit for  2  months and did absolutely nothing negligent
or illegal and all your  appliances  were in good working order when you
left, etc., etc. And, a month  after your absence there was an electrical
failure in your refrigerator that  caused  a fire that damaged the common
area and/or your neighboring units YOU  ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL
DAMAGE.  Lack of malicious intent, negligence,  etc.  ARE NOT MATERIAL to
your civil responsibility for the damage. PERIOD.  NO EXCEPTIONS. </big></li>
        <big>    </big><big><br>
        </big><big>    </big><li><big> Insurance companies do NOT determine
fault or responsibility.  They   ONLY  determine whether or not they are
required under the terms of their    insurance contract to defend and/or
reimburse their insured for damage  claims.  In order to grasp this concept
you need to understand the legal    relationships of the parties involved.
 Here goes: </big><big><br>
          </big><big>      </big><big><br>
          </big><big>     A. The insurance company only has a contract with
the purchaser of the    insurance -- called the insured -- to defend and
indemnify the insured for   claims and damages as defined in the contract.
 The ONLY possible legal    relationship involved here is the contractual
relationship between the   insurance company and the insured.  Please note
this relationship does not,   and cannot legally, encompass, bind and/or
impact any relationship with   third parties not specifically named in the
contract. </big><big><br>
          </big><big>      </big><big><br>
          </big><big>     B. Damage claims CANNOT made against the damaging
party's insurance company    because the damaged party has NO legal relationship
with the insurance   company.  THIS IS A CRITICAL POINT.  Damage claims can
only be made against    the damaging party. </big><big><br>
          </big><big>      </big><big><br>
          </big><big>     C. If the insurance company of a damaging party
refuses coverage THIS  DOES   NOT RELIEVE THE DAMAGING PARTY OF RESPONSIBILITY.
 It only means the   damaging party will not receive financial assistance
from their insurance    company regarding the claim.  That is the damaging
party's misfortune; but   it has ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT on the damaging party's
responsibility for the   damage.     </big><big><br>
          </big><big>      </big><big><br>
          </big><big>    </big></li>
        <big>         </big>
      </ol>
         
      <p><big> Virtually all insurance   coverage is predicated upon what
is known as a "SUDDEN EVENT".  For example,   if your car is damaged due
to an accident  (a sudden event) you have   coverage; but if your car is
damaged due to rust,  you do NOT have coverage.   Since, the insurance company
has determined the  damage was caused by wear   and tear they have properly
and legally denied  coverage to their INSURED.   Conversely, if a pipe had
broken causing a flood  (a sudden event) the    insurance company would have
been legally required  to provide coverage   to their INSURED.  </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    Note the repeated references to coverage to the INSURED
-- note also, there   is NO reference to coverage for the damaged party for
the reasons  outlined   above.  AGAIN, the denial of coverage does NOT relieve
the damaging  party  of responsibility for the damage it only means the damaging
party cannot get financial aid from their insurance company to repair the
damage caused by their property.  </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    Since we own our condominiums, we are each responsible
for the actions  of our condominium property.  Therefore, it is wise to periodically 
inspect   our property for items such as water leaks, electrical problems, 
etc. as we  are each responsible for any damage caused by their failures. 
 Our units and their infrastructure are human created physical devices and 
ALL will fail  in some manner sooner or later.  Failures are more than an 
inconvenience,  they usually are expensive and often DANGEROUS.  Failing to
inspect, make timely repairs, and maintain your property is irresponsible 
and just plain stupid  as it endangers not only your bank account; but jeopardizes 
the property,    health and life of both you and your neighbors.  </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    If you are not qualified to inspect and/or maintain your
property you can  have your home inspected by professional services usually
for a few hundred  dollars -- a wise investment that I make about every 5
years.  Professionals   not only know more, they have instruments and experience 
that allow them   to detect problems even the most conscientious homeowner 
would miss.  The  very idea that a homeowner would risk a third of a million 
dollar investment  plus their lives and those of their neighbors to save less
money than they would pay for haircuts strikes me as the height of false economy
and I have little sympathy for those who would risk the property, life and
health of their neighbors in this manner. </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    Water damage cannot be ignored as it has serious implications 
beyond the  immediate visible damage such as: dry-rot, fungus/mold growth, 
termite infestation, electrical service, electrical alarm, telephone, TV cable
failures, etc.  In addition, water damage does NOT repair itself over time,
it only gets worse.  Ignoring water damage can easily convert a $500 repair
into a $20,000 repair -- this can and HAS happened already numerous times
 at the Murieta. </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    The HOA is responsible for the health and safety of our
residents as well   as the preservation and enhancement of the value of our
property. Accordingly,  the HOA must and will take whatever legal actions
are  necessary (up to  and including lawsuits, foreclosure and confiscation
and sale of an individual's  condominium and property) to protect the interests
of the Community.  These  are not pleasant tasks to consider or perform;
but under the law the Board  of Directors has no alternative but to obey
the law.  Anything less, makes  the Board of Directors liable for the damages
as well.  </big></p>
         
      <p><big>    Finally, to sell a unit without disclosing known damage
is felony fraud  and would make the seller subject to up to 5 years in prison
plus punitive  damages which could be as much as 3 times the sale price.
 Also, no unit  can be sold without a property and document inspection which
will turn up the problem.  Under the lending codes, the damage would have
to be repaired  prior to completion of the sale.  If that were not enough,
no sale can be completed without the HOA's escrow package which gives the
HOA the power (and responsibility) to prevent any sale where we are aware
of problems.   </big></p>
